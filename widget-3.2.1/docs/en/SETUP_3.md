## Events of the widget

During the operation of the widget, 3 types of events occur, to which you can subscribe a handler function to allow
to receive data from the widget: widget loading, delivery calculation, and user selection.

### The widget has finished loading (onReady)

The event is triggered when the widget has loaded all styles, scripts, maps, as well as information about cities and
points of issue
orders. It means that you can already use the widget's methods. Please note that the HTML and layout of the maps at this
point still
may not load.
There are no passed parameters in the event.

### The widget has calculated the delivery price (onCalculate)

The event is triggered when the widget receives data about the cost and delivery time.

The event passes two parameters to the handler function: an object with tariffs and an address object.

The tariff object has the following structure:

```
{
    office: {
        tariff_code: number,
        tariff_name: string,
        tariff_description: string,
        delivery_mode: number,
        period_min: number,
        period_max: number,
        delivery_sum: number,
    }[], 
    door: {
        tariff_code: number,
        tariff_name: string,
        tariff_description: string,
        delivery_mode: number,
        period_min: number,
        period_max: number,
        delivery_sum: number,
    }[],
    pickup: {
        tariff_code: number,
        tariff_name: string,
        tariff_description: string,
        delivery_mode: number,
        period_min: number,
        period_max: number,
        delivery_sum: number,
    }[],
}
```

The address object has the following structure:

```
{ code?: number; address?: string }
```

Where `address` is filled in when selecting delivery to the address, and `code` is the city code of the selected pickup
point (if delivery to the pickup point is selected)

### The user has selected the tariff and delivery address (onChoose)

The event is triggered when you click on the "Select" button in the delivery menu for the pickup point and the address.

The event passes three parameters to the handler function:
the selected delivery mode, the selected tariff, and the selected address.
Depending on the selected mode, the address object will be different.

The delivery mode is a string that has the value `door` or `office`.
The tariff object has the following structure:

```
{
    tariff_code: number,
    tariff_name: string,
    tariff_description: string,
    delivery_mode: number,
    period_min: number,
    period_max: number,
    delivery_sum: number,
}
```

Address object for `office` mode:

```
{
    city_code: number,
    city: string,
    type: string,
    country_code: string,
    have_cashless: boolean,
    have_cash: boolean,
    allowed_cod: boolean,
    is_dressing_room: boolean,
    code: string,
    name: string,
    address: string,
    work_time: string,
    location: number[],
}
```

Address object for `door` mode:

```
{
    name: string,
    position: number[],
    kind: string,
    precision: string,
    formatted: string,
}
```

## Methods to control the widget

A widget object, once created, has several public methods that you can use to control the widget's state.

### Operations with parcels

To change/set the parameters of the cargo being sent, you must use the following methods:

| Method name                           | Method description                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| addParcel(parcel: iParcel\|iParcel[]) | Adds a cargo (or array of cargo) described as iParcel[^4] to a parcel without clearing it. The cost will be refreshed automatically |
| getParcels()                          | Returns cargo data in the form of an array containing iParcel[^4]                                                                   |
| resetParcels()                        | Resets information about the cargo used by the widget                                                                               |

[^4]: Object with structure: `{width: number, height: number, length: number, weight: number}`

### Visual part

When a widget has been created with the `popup` parameter set to `true`, you can control the visibility of the widget
using the following methods:

| Method name | Method description          |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| open()      | Shows a popup with a widget |
| close()     | Hides a popup with a widget |
